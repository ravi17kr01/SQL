*************Approach 1 : CTE and union ALL**************

SELECT * FROM left_split UNION ALL SELECT * FROM right_split
)

SELECT room_types,count(*) AS 'count'  FROM combine_left_And_Right GROUP BY room_types ORDER BY count DESC ;

*************Approach 2 : substring_index***************


*************Approach 3 : pivot************************
